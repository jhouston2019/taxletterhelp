        <h1>IRS Letter Is Confusing – How to Understand What the IRS Wants</h1>
        
        <p>IRS letters are often written in technical language that can be difficult to understand. Here's how to decode your notice and determine what action you need to take.</p>

        <div class="cta-box">
            <h2>Get Plain-English Explanation</h2>
            <p>Upload your IRS letter for a clear explanation and next-step guidance</p>

        </div>

        <h2>Key Information in Every IRS Letter</h2>
        
        <p>Every IRS notice contains these essential elements:</p>
        
        <div class="info-box">
            <h3>What to Look For</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Notice Number</strong> – Upper right corner (e.g., CP14, CP2000, LT11)</li>
                <li><strong>Tax Year</strong> – Which year the notice concerns</li>
                <li><strong>Amount</strong> – Dollar figure (if applicable)</li>
                <li><strong>Deadline</strong> – Date by which you must respond</li>
                <li><strong>Action Required</strong> – Usually in bold near the top or in a box</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Common Confusing IRS Phrases and What They Mean</h2>
        
        <h3>"Proposed Changes to Your Tax Return"</h3>
        <p>The IRS is suggesting you owe more money (or will receive a smaller refund) based on information they have. This is not final – you can dispute it.</p>
        
        <h3>"Notice of Deficiency"</h3>
        <p>The IRS believes you owe additional tax. You have 90 days to file a petition with the U.S. Tax Court if you disagree. This is a serious notice.</p>
        
        <h3>"Intent to Levy"</h3>
        <p>The IRS is notifying you they will seize your property, wages, or bank account if you do not respond. This is a final warning.</p>
        
        <h3>"Balance Due"</h3>
        <p>You owe money from a previous tax return. Interest and penalties are accruing.</p>
        
        <h3>"Underreported Income"</h3>
        <p>The IRS has records showing you received income that was not reported on your tax return.</p>

        <div class="warning-box">
            <h3>Red Flags (High Priority Response Required)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>"Final Notice" – Last warning before enforcement action</li>
                <li>"Intent to Levy" – Wage garnishment or bank levy imminent</li>
                <li>"Notice of Deficiency" – 90-day deadline to petition Tax Court</li>
                <li>"Audit" or "Examination" – Documentation request or in-person meeting</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>What to Do If You Still Don't Understand</h2>
        
        <div class="action-box">
            <h3>Next Steps</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Call the phone number on the notice during business hours (8am-5pm local IRS office time)</li>
                <li>Request a plain-language explanation of what the notice means</li>
                <li>Ask specifically: "What action am I required to take?" and "What is my deadline?"</li>
                <li>Take notes during the call, including the IRS representative's name and ID number</li>
                <li>Upload your letter to get automated explanation and response guidance</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
