        <h1>IRS Letter Deadline Already Passed – What to Do Now</h1>
        
        <p>Missing an IRS deadline is serious but not irreversible. The appropriate response depends on which notice you missed and how much time has passed. Act immediately to minimize consequences.</p>

        <div class="cta-box">
            <h2>Prepare Late Response</h2>
            <p>Upload your notice for guidance on responding after the deadline</p>

        <h2>What Happens When You Miss an IRS Deadline</h2>
        
        <p>Consequences depend on the notice type:</p>
        
        <div class="warning-box">
            <h3>Missed CP14/CP501/CP503 Deadline</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The debt remains and interest continues to accrue</li>
                <li>You will receive an escalated notice (CP503 or CP504)</li>
                <li>You can still arrange payment or payment plan</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="warning-box">

                <li>The IRS may issue a statutory notice of deficiency</li>
                <li>Proposed changes may become final</li>
                <li>You may still submit a late response with explanation</li>
                <li>If already final, you may need to file an amended return or pay the assessment</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="warning-box">
            <h3>Missed CP504/LT11/CP90 Deadline (CRITICAL)</h3>

        <h2>Immediate Actions to Take</h2>
        
        <div class="action-box">
            <h3>Do These Things Today</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Identify the exact notice type and original deadline</li>
                <li>Calculate how many days past the deadline you are</li>
                <li>Call the IRS phone number on the notice immediately</li>

        </div>

        <h2>Can You Still Respond After the Deadline?</h2>
        
        <p>Yes, in most cases a late response is better than no response:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Balance Due Notices</strong> – You can still pay or request a payment plan at any time</li>
            <li><strong>CP2000 (Income Mismatch)</strong> – Late responses may be accepted if you provide reasonable cause for the delay</li>
            <li><strong>Levy Notices</strong> – You may request an equivalent hearing or appeal if you have not already received a Collection Due Process hearing</li>
            <li><strong>Audit Notices</strong> – Contact immediately to reschedule or explain the missed deadline</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Penalty Abatement for Missed Deadlines</h2>
