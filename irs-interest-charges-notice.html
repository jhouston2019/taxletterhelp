        <h1>IRS Interest Charges Notice</h1>
        
        <p>The IRS charges interest on unpaid tax from the due date of the return until the date you pay in full. Interest compounds daily and cannot be abated except in cases of IRS error.</p>

        <div class="cta-box">
            <h2>Respond to Interest Charges</h2>
            <p>Upload your notice for payment options and interest calculation review</p>

        </div>

        <h2>How IRS Interest Is Calculated</h2>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Interest rate is set quarterly by the IRS (federal short-term rate plus 3%)</li>
            <li>Interest compounds daily on the unpaid balance</li>
            <li>Interest accrues on both unpaid tax and unpaid penalties</li>
            <li>Interest begins accruing from the original return due date</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Can IRS Interest Be Reduced or Abated?</h2>
        
        <div class="warning-box">
            <h3>When Interest Can Be Abated</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>IRS error or delay in processing your payment</li>
                <li>IRS unreasonable error or delay in performing ministerial or managerial acts</li>
                <li>IRS provided incorrect written advice</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <p>Interest abatement is rare. The IRS will not abate interest simply because you cannot afford to pay.</p>

        <h2>How to Stop Interest from Accruing</h2>
        
        <div class="action-box">
            <h3>Only One Way to Stop Interest</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Pay the full balance (tax + penalties + interest) immediately</li>
                <li>Interest stops accruing the day the IRS receives full payment</li>
                <li>Installment agreements do NOT stop interest from accruing – interest continues until paid in full</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>What If You Cannot Pay?</h2>
        
        <p>If you cannot pay the full amount immediately:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Installment Agreement</strong> – Pay over time (interest continues to accrue at reduced rate)</li>
            <li><strong>Currently Not Collectible Status</strong> – Temporarily suspend collection (interest continues to accrue)</li>
            <li><strong>Offer in Compromise</strong> – Settle the debt for less (interest stops if offer is accepted)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Disputing Interest Charges</h2>
        
        <p>You can dispute interest charges if:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>The IRS made an error in calculating the starting date</li>
            <li>The IRS delayed processing your payment</li>
            <li>You made payments that were not properly credited</li>
            <li>The underlying tax liability was incorrect</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Submit a written request for interest abatement with Form 843 and supporting documentation.</p>
